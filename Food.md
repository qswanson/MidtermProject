# Welcome to the Food Page!
Although I love to indulge in a variety of different junk foods or just generally unhealthy foods,
I also love to eat a proper diet.

The healthy foods that I try to include in my diet are:
- Whole grains.
- Vegetables like carrots and broccoli.
- lots of lean meats like chicken to gain protein.
- Nutrient-dense foods like spinach, peanuts, and fish.
- Fruits such as strawberries and bananas.
