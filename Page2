# Welcome to the Sports Page!
One of my favorite things, all my life, has been sports.  
They bring me a lot of happiness when watching them and I feel fulfilled when I am able to play  
them and compete!

If I had to pick my 3 *favorite* sports it would be:
1. Football
2. Basketball
3. Hockey

### Chicago Bears  
This is my favorite football team.
